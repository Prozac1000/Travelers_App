          We envision a world where everyone feels welcome in the world hiking
          community and has permanent access to meaningful hiking, including
          urban, frontcountry, and backcountry opportunities. We will achieve
          this vision by empowering all communities to enjoy, share, and
          preserve the hiking experience; advocating for the protection and
          expansion of hiking spaces; fostering trail stewardship; and
          collaborating with partners whose strengths are complementary.

          Our Core Values 1. We Are Hikers We share our love of hiking. We
          achieve our mission through uniting the diverse hiking community. 2.
          Hiking Matters We believe in hikingâ€™s transformative power: It boosts
          mental and physical health, engenders respect for ourselves and our
          surroundings, and creates and strengthens a sense of community. 3.
          Trails Are for Everyone We believe that everyone should feel welcome
          as a hiker on all trails. Hiking offers low-threshold access to a
          positive outdoor social activity available to all. 4. We Share the
          Trail We collaborate with partners that complement our strengths and
          weaknesses, rather than competing. We convene, amplify, and lead,
          rather than direct. 5. Hiking Inspires Sustainability We protect the
          places we love. Because hiking directly engages hikers with their
          surroundings, it invites deeper personal connections with that land,
          leading to a commitment to care and advocate for its health and
          preservation.
